# BannerlordModule

I'll rename the title of this project eventually but I am working on a mod for Bannerlord like it says.

The mod involves creating a new side to all of the bandits on the map. Instead of them being random parties, I am going to create an opportunity for them to become organized crime syndicates. Eventually I plan to tie this in with the way that the players Roguery skill works, and for it to create new opportunites to level it. This I hope will also create more threats and more interesting targets on the map besides enemy kingdoms and the few minor factions that are present. I also plan to make plenty of quests for the bandits to provide for the player, and I also want to integrate the security of kingdoms into how effective bandits can be and how they can spawn.
